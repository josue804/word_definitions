# _Personal Dictionary: Definition Dojo_

##### _Allows user to add and store words along with their multiple definitions, August 14, 2015_

#### By _**Josue Valverde**_

## Description

_This application receives a word from the user, creates a Word object out of the string and stores it in an array of Word objects. Each one of these objects holds an array of Definition objects. When the user inputs a definition for a word, the program stores the new Definition object into the correct Word's Definition array (using the id that each word has). The program can then loop through the arrays of each word to return its definitions._

## Setup

* _'clone' git repository_
* _'$ bundle install' to install Ruby Gems_
* _'$ ruby app.rb' to run application locally_
* _go to 'localhost:STAGE' in your browser to load local application_

## Technologies Used
